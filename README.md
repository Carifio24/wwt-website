# WorldWideTelescope.org web site code
WorldWide Telescope (WWT) enables you to explore the universe, bringing together imagery from the best ground- and space-based telescopes in the world and combining it with 3D navigation, data visualization, and more. Please see [WorldWideTelescope.org](http://WorldWideTelescope.org/) for an overview.

This repository contains all the working web site code for WorldWideTelescope.org, minus imagery, tours, and binaries that are downloadable from the site.  Connection strings and other instance-specific data have also been removed.

See INSTALL.md document for build and execution instructions.

We plan to add more documentation to this README soon, but in the meantime please see also:
