# AAS WorldWide Telescope website

This repository contains the code for the web services backing the
[AAS](https://aas.org/) [WorldWide
Telescope](https://worldwidetelescope.org/home) (WWT) software system.

**Note** The contents of this repository are in flux as we modernize this
codebase.


## Installation Instructions

**To be revised**. Some *old* notes are in [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).


## Getting involved

We love it when people get involved in the WWT community! You can get started by
[participating in our user forum][forum] or by [signing up for our low-traffic
newsletter][newsletter]. If you would like to help make WWT better, our
[Contributor Hub] aims to be your one-stop shop for information about how to
contribute to the project, with the [Contributors’ Guide] being the first thing
you should read. Here on GitHub we operate with a standard [fork-and-pull]
model.
