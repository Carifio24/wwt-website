<p>The WorldWide Telescope SDK enables custom web applications and custom data to be developed and used with Microsoft
WorldWide Telescope.</p>
<p>There are currently two versions of WorldWide Telescope -- the Windows 
application and the Web Control. The Windows version has more features (such as 
the 3-D Solar System) but cannot be customized by the use of scripts, though can 
use custom data files. The Web Control can be customized with both scripts and data.</p>
<h2><a name="Documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
<p>The SDK documentation is organized into four components:</p>
<ul>
<LI>The <A HREF="WorldWideTelescopeWebControlScriptReference.html">WorldWide Telescope Web Control Script Reference</A> 
is for use with the Web Control only, and describes the API set and use of 
JScript to build custom user interfaces, load custom data, and other types of 
application.</LI>
<li>The <A HREF="WorldWideTelescopeDataFilesReference.html">
WorldWide Telescope Data Files Reference</A> document describes the data file 
types and formats, including studies (single images of an object in space), 
surveys (images of the entire sky), tours (animated slide-shows) and communities 
(public or private groups of users).</li>
<LI>The <A HREF="WorldWideTelescopeDataToolsGuide.html">WorldWide Telescope Data Tools Guide</A> describes the use of two
tools: The Study Chopper and Sphere Toaster. These tools make the preparation of image data for WorldWide Telescope relatively
easy.</LI>
<LI>The <A HREF="WorldWideTelescopeProjectionReference.html">WorldWide Telescope Projection Reference</A> contains background
information on the projection systems used by WorldWide Telescope.</LI>
