<p>This document describes the components and purpose of the WorldWide Telescope 
SDK
. The SDK primarily enables applications to be written to transmit data to be 
rendered in WorldWide Telescope, and to prepare tile pyramids in the correct 
format for rendering specific regions or specific datasets (such as weather or 
atmospheric data) for the Earth, or even entire planets or moons. </p>

	(this is required if the
	<a href="WorldWideTelescopeTilePyramidSDKSamples.html#To_Setup_the_Sharing_Service">Sharing Service</a> 
	tool is to be deployed).</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/experienceit/experienceit.aspx?page=downloadwwt">WorldWide Telescope Windows Client</a></li>
	<li><a href="worldwidetelescopetilepyramidsdksamples.html#To_Install_IIS_7.5_on_Windows_7">IIS with default web site and default application pool configured to use .Net 4.0.</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Hardware</h4>
<ul>
	<li>A 64-bit dual-core processor is recommended, though a 32-bit is 
	sufficient.</li>
	<li>4 GB of physical memory</li>
</ul>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p>The SDK is installed from the WWTSDK.msi file, and by default files are 
written to the folder:</p>
<p><strong>%Program Files%\Microsoft Research\WorldWide Telescope 
SDK</strong></p>

	<h5>Documentation</h5>
	</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>LCAPI (Layer Control API) Sample</strong></td><td>The Layer Control API 
	provides an extensive range of functions to transmit and receive data to and 
	from WorldWide Telescope. The purpose of this API is that it enables custom 
	applications to be built that typically transmit time-series spreadsheet 
	data to WorldWide Telescope to be rendered appropriately, though other layer 
	data (point data, 3d Models, images) can also be handled.<br><br>The sample 
	displays a typical use of the LCAPI, displaying a time-series of earthquake 
	data.</td><td>
	<a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/Docs/WorldWideTelescope_lcapi.html">
	WorldWide Telescope LCAPI</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Tile Pyramid SDK</strong></td><td>This SDK provides samples and 
	source code that enable the tiling of one or multiple images into a format 
	suitable for WorldWide Telescope. The working samples show how to handle a 
	single image, multiple images, DEM (altitude) data, and specific regions 
	rather than an entire planet or moon. <br><br>The Tile Generator is included as a 
	fully functional application. This tool takes as input an image in 
	Equirectangular or Mercator projection and a bounding set of coordinates in 
	case the map only covers a section of the world. The output can be either 
	Mercator or Toast projection, both suitable for WorldWide Telescope. An 
	optional plate file can be created, and some details such as credits can be 
	included in the output data files.</td><td>

<tr><td><strong>Sharing Service</strong></td><td>This includes samples and 
	source code showing how to share tiled pyramids, and also how to build 
	communities and share tours, data and links with colleagues.</td><td>

<tr><td><strong>Sphere Toaster</strong></td><td>The Sphere Toaster is a legacy 
	tool that takes as input a single image (typically of an entire planet or 
	moon) and generates a complete tile pyramid for the image in Toast format, 
	including the required thumbnail image and WTML data files to provide easy 
	access to the pyramid.<br>Toast format is specific to WorldWide Telescope, 
	and provides a projection that minimizes distortion and enables the north 
	and south pole to be rendered.</td><td>

	WorldWide Telescope Data Tools Guide</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Study Chopper</strong></td><td>The Study Chopper is a legacy 
	tool that takes an image (typically a telescope image of a distant stellar 
	object) and tiles the image into a format that is usually added to the Sky 
	view of WorldWide Telescope. For example, a very detailed Hubble Space 
	Telescope image of a distant galaxy could be prepared for use as a 
	foreground image in WorldWide Telescope using this tool.<br>Thumbnail images 
	and WTML data files are also produced by the tool.</td><td>

<h2><a name="Known_Issues">Known Issues</a></h2>
<ul>
	<li>The SDK currently provides samples for the tiling of image files 
	(.png,.jpg,.jpeg,.tif,.tiff) and xyz files (comma separated containing lat, 
	long and depth values). The SDK source code is provided so it can be 
	extended to support other input file formats. </li>
	<li>Processing large sets of data is dependent on the amount of memory 
	available in your system. For larger datasets consider increasing the 
	available memory on your system. </li>
	<li>When using the Sharing Service with a Community folder that is 
	configured on a remote network location WorldWide Telescope might time-out 
	before the whole payload file is loaded. In this case reselecting the 
	Community thumbnail in WorldWide Telescope should load the community payload 
	file in stages - several iterations of this may be necessary for a large 
	payload file.</li>
	<li>In the LCAPI Sample, when loading a file, the <strong>Data visualization 
	Layer</strong> dialog shown by WWT will be hidden behind the LCAPI sample 
	window and will need to be activated manually.</li>
	<li>The Tile Generator tool only supports images with longitude values 
	increasing from left to right and latitude values decreasing from top to 
	bottom.</li>
