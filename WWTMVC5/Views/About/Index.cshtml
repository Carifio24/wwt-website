    <h1 class="text-info">About</h1>
    <p>The WorldWide Telescope (WWT) is a visualization environment that enables your computer to function as a virtual telescope—bringing together imagery from the world’s best ground- and space-based telescopes for the exploration of the universe. WWT blends terabytes of images, information, and stories from multiple sources into a seamless, immersive, rich media experience.  Explorers of all ages will feel empowered to explore and understand the cosmos using WWT’s simple and powerful user interface.</p>
    <p>The mission of the WorldWide Telescope is twofold:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To aggregate scientific data from major telescopes, observatories, and institutions and make temporal and multi-spectral studies available through a single, cohesive Internet–based portal</li>
    <li>To stimulate interest in science among younger generations, providing a compelling base for teaching astronomy, scientific discovery, and computational science</li>
</ul>
    <p>WorldWide Telescope is dedicated to the memory of Jim Gray. It is a free, open-source resource to the astronomy and education communities with the hope that it will inspire and empower people to explore and understand the universe like never before.</p>
